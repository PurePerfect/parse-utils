Contains some improvements for parsing character streams over common IO libraries. E.g: match support, extended peeks, position in line, consistent mark/reset support, multiple charsets,  etc. This project exists because I needed a stream API that didn't suck swampy Gorilla anus and one didn't exist, so I wrote this instead.


It would be nice to add matchers for Strings in addition to the ones that exist for characters, but IDNI. This project is defect-free and 100% test covered so you can consider version 0.1 to be the final release until I need it to do something it doesn't already.
